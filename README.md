Project done for the [FEUP  Algorithm Design course](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/ucurr_geral.ficha_uc_view?pv_ocorrencia_id=520321)

In this project we had different sized CSV's in order to perform some tasks on them.


The first exercise (21) we were asked to implement a TSP algorithm to find the minimum distance needed to traverse in order to visit all the points.
For this exercise we used a backtrack approach.


For the second exercise (22) we aimed for the same information, but this time using a Triangular Approximation algorithm.


For the third exercise (23) we are asked to use two possible alternative solutions to resolve this problem. 
We used a Lin Kernighan algorithm as a first approach and used a combination of nearest path and triangular approximation to do our own implementation.
